Sample antlr grammar for the SPICE 2G6 language. Detects include statements, elements of scheme (diods, resistors, capacities and so on), models, subcircuits, AC commands.
I don't have a canonical description of the language, so there can be my assumptions and simplifications.

If you find this grammar useful, feel free to donate via Paypal krjukov@gmail.com - composing of the grammar was time consuming.

If you want to contribute, you are welcome. Please provide the sample files you used as well.

If you need further development (additional elements and types of commands, parameters in models. I can compose an application based on this grammar say in java), please contact me krjukov@gmail.com.
